droid-hal device packaging converter: from monolithic to modular
Copyright (c) 2015 Jolla Ltd.
Contact: Simonas Leleiva <simonas.leleiva@jollamobile.com>

We are migrating from monolithic to modular packaging for hardware adaptations.

Monolithic (droid-hal-device) has become too cluttered. Benefits of new layout:
* Contributions from vendors (such as Jolla) to the new packaging layout
* One set of repos per device - cleaner code and more re-usability (common repo contains most changes)
* Changelog per-device
* OBS builds

Location:
hybris/dhd2modular/

Typical usage:
# Have your old monolithic repos ready as per HADK v1.0.3.0, device image
# built from earler and device booting up fine as per your port state. Then:
MER_SDK $
hadk
cd $ANDROID_ROOT
hybris/dhd2modular/dhd2modular.sh migrate
hybris/dhd2modular/dhd2modular.sh build

TODO:
* Pattern templates and for every porter to then update from:
  * add droid-hal-version-$DEVICE
  * remove corresponding droid-*config* packages that d-h-version Requires

UNTESTED: Build installation .zip and deploy to your device

If device doesn't work as before, try to find what broke (Really Sherlock?!:)
UNTESTED: You can also perform:
hybris/dhd2modular/dhd2modular.sh snapshot monolithic
hybris/dhd2modular/dhd2modular.sh snapshot modular
diff -ru tmp-dhd2modular/droid-*-repo/$DEVICE

^ this will help you fish out any suspicious differences

Let's DIT \o/
